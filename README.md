# semitoggle

## Features
This extension comes with two commands: `Add Semicolons` and `Remove Semicolons`.

If the current file is JavaScript, you can run these commands to add/remove all optional semicolons.

This extension depends on Acorn.js to parse the code, which fails if there are any syntax errors and unfortunately it does not support TypeScript. It does, however, support React/JSX.
